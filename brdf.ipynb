    "\n",
    "When light hits on a surface, the behaviors vary depending on the properties of the surface. Light can be **absorbed, reflected, and transmitted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In rendering we typically only consider the reflected and transmitted light, both phenomena can be referred as scattering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal diffuse reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "light is reflected in all directions\n",
    "\n",
    "colored by surface color\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal specular reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "light reflected/refracted in single direction respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "colored by source color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "because we can choose infinite amount of ray directions, direction ray choices contribute differently to the final image. we need to reduce the amount of time required to rendering an image, that's why we probably need to sample rays that will contribute more to the final image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we sample lambertian material brdf with a cosine weighted hemisphere sampling. because the cosine term in rendering equation, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "opaque objects exhibit little or no transmittance, while translucent objects can have reflectance and transmittance.\n",

    "A few simplied analytical models are developed:\n",

    "We model reflection as mainly mixture of a few \"ideal\" reflection functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ideal Diffuse: This is the simplest form of reflection. which means light will be **uniformly** scattered on the upper hemisphere of the light-surface intersection point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ideal Specular: When the incoming light is reflected perfectly on the mirror direction around the normal vector of the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ideal Specular Transmission: \n",
    "\n",
    "Most material models will be a combined function of the two. \n",
